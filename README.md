# donut-shop
// The Current copy of my donut shop has an object constructor that creates a random number, representing sales, within a certain range and totals it for the day. The table is hard wired into the HTML page and the Js pages speaks to it. Seeing Emere's javascript was erally helpful in being able to see that I didn't need multiple for loops or to many prototypes.

Added a new font wasn't able to get the second font to show up in the tables or the text input area. I included a picture in a fixed position. I kept it white becuase that was the color palete that I liked the best for the moment.
